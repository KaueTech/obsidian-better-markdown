## ‚úçÔ∏è Usage

### 1. Inline Formatting

There are six inline formattings that currently developed in this plugin:

| Type        | Syntax                 | Result                                                        |
| ----------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| insertion   | `++your text++`        | <ins>your text</ins>                                          |
| spoiler     | `\|\|your text\|\|`    | <span style="background:#2e2e2e">your text</span>             |
| superscript | `^your-text^`          | <sup>your-text</sup>                                          |
| subscript   | `~your-text~`          | <sub>your-text</sub>                                          |
| highlight   | `=={color}your text==` | <mark>your text</mark>                                        |
| custom span | `!!{myCls}your text!!` | your text (should be rendered with the `myCls` class defined) |

By default:
- **insertion** give the text underline style,
- **spoiler** hide the text and can be revealed by clicking it (or hovering over it in editor mode),
- **superscript** and **subscript** make the text being raised or lowered as `<sup>` and `<sub>` do.

Additionally, for the **highlight** and **custom span**, you may insert a tag right after the opening delimiter, specifying the color for the highlight, and the classes for the custom span.

### 2. Block Formatting

Currenty, this plugin only support **Pandoc-style fenced div** with some modifications. You only need an opening delimiter (three consecutive colons at least) to start the syntax. Blank line or the end of the document will act as a syntax closing. No need of closing delimiter.

```markdown
::: my-class-1 my-class-2
This is fenced div content.

::: another-class
Another fenced div content.
```

### 3. Customizable Highlight

Under "Custom highlight" section in the settings, you can:

- **show the color button**, providing color menu when you click on it,
- **adjust opacity** of the highlight,
- **customize color palettes** based on its tag:
    - first field for its name displayed in the color menu,
    - second field for its tag inserted into the highlight syntax,
    - show or hide each palette from the color menu,
    - rearrange colors by dragging 6-dots icon on the left side.

### 4. Predefined Tags

In the settings, you can predefine specific tags for **custom span** and **fenced div**, then can be displayed in the tag menu. Same as the color palattes, you can set their name and arrange them.

### 5. Commands and Context Menu

This plugin provides commands to toggle each formatting type, also commands to show the color and tag menu. You can set the keymap for each of them through "Hotkeys" in the settings.

It also brings functionality of all those commands (except for fenced div) to the context menu, by right-clicking on the editor and choosing "More format".

> [!Note]
>
> In mobile devices, those commands can be added into the toolbar.

### 6. Tidier Formatting

With "Tidier formatting" enabled in the settings, you can format a single word simply by placing the cursor on it, without the need to select the entire word. Otherwise, it acts like a normal wrapper.

> You don't need to reload the app after changing the settings.

### 7. Other Tweaks

- Enable/disable each formatting type individually under "Syntax switch" section.
- Prevent fenced div from being styled in source mode.
- Specifies when tags should be displayed under "Tag display behavior" section.
- etc...

## üé® Styling Custom Spans and Fenced Divs

With tag attached to them, you can insert your own CSS style rules based on their tag. For instance, you can apply this CSS rules to the markdown below:

```css
.text-large { font-size: 48px }
.text-green { color: green }

.align-center { text-align: center }
.bordered { border: 4px solid red }
```

```markdown
!!{text-large text-green}Large text with green color.!!

:::align-center bordered
Should be aligned to the center
and bordered.
```

## ‚ùì FAQ's

### Is it working on the table and callout?
Of course it's working on both, except for the fenced div.

### Does the plugin work on large files?
I tested it on a 250kB file and it's still working fine. This plugin also uses parser that implemented simple incremental and partial parsing, so you don't need to worry about facing with large files. But if you still have some issues with it, feel free to inform me what the issues you are struggling with.

### Will it cause conflict with other plugins that concerns extending syntax?
It depends on what character the others use in their syntax.
